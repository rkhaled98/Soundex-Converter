# Soundex-Converter

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex), Soundex is a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, as pronounced in English. The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling.

To use the converter, simply clone the repository and run `./soundex2.py <Word To Convert>` in a terminal.
